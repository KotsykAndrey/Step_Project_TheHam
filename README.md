I have developed a training project, a landing website focused on selling WordPress themes. The website features various sliders and implements immitation of image loading from the server by click on button.

The project showcases my proficiency in front-end development, demonstrating my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and visually appealing user interface.
